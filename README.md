# WordLadder
This C program parses a dictionary file and generates "word ladders" in which selected words are used as the "top" and "bottom" rungs, and each word in between only has one letter changed at a time. This algorithm calculates the shortest possible ladder between any two words, or whether a ladder is impossible.
